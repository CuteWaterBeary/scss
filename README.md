* Customisable lighting through light ramp textures
* Specular and smoothness functionality similar to Unity's Standard shader
* Shadow mask texture for painting areas of shadow or light bias, for ambient occlusion and/or keeping areas lit more consistently without having to change vertex normals
* Customisable ambient fresnel and emissive fresnel for shiny effects
* Customisable additive and multiplicative matcaps, anchored in world-space so they won't sway when you turn your head
* Lots and lots of advanced options for blend mode and more
* A render queue slider (note: VRchat currently overrides custom render queues set this way)
* Cleaner outlines that reduce size based on camera proximity

Tested with Unity 5.6.3p1 and Unity 2017.4.15f1 LTS.
